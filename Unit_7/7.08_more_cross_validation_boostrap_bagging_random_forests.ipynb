    "- Bootstrap - To produce a reliable estimate we need enough samples in the dataset but sometimes it is not possible to collect enough real data. Bootstrap method allows us to emulate the process of obtaining new sample sets from the original data. Hence bootstrapping is the process of generating distinct data sets by repeatedly sampling observations (with replacement) from the original data set.\n",

    "In the image above, we are generating `B` bootstrap samples from the original dataset. Since sampling is done with replacement, you would observe some repetition in the rows in some bootstrap samples. Each bootstrap sample is used to estimate alpha (for example which could be a measure of accuracy for a linear regression model). Then we take the mean of all alpha scores to obtain a more reliable final estimate."

    "\n",
    "  - One of the disadvantages with decision trees is that they have high variability in the result ie the results produced can vary greatly in their accuracy measures. This can be seen from the snapshot here: [link to the image - High Variance in Output for Regression Trees](https://education-team-2020.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/data-analytics/7.08/7.08-high_variability.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bagging is a general purpose technique that is used to reduce variance in a machine learning model. The idea is to use B Bootstrap samples and find the accuracy measure for each bootstrap sample. And then aggregate the results of all the bootstrap samples. This method is particularly useful for decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bagging applied decision trees: B bootstrapped training sets are sampled from the original data. On each bootstrap sample, a decision tree is fit and a prediction is made. Then we average the resulting predictions. These trees are grown deep and have high variance. Averaging these B trees reduces the variance.\n",

    "- Random Forests are very similar to bagging except for one improvement over bagging method in terms of randomization of features chosen while building a tree for each bootstrap sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It also consists of building a large number of trees (a decision for each bootstrap sample).\n",
    "- For each decision tree for each bootstrap sample, instead of picking all the features while making the decision tree, only a random sample of `m` features are chosen from the total set of `p` predictors.\n",
